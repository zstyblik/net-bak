# README file for net-bak:

net-bak is a very simple set of scripts for backing-up OpenWRT 
devices over the network.


## Requirements

* ssh ~ at server
* mailx ~ at server
* tar ~ at OpenWRT node


## How-to use it

1.) run % net-bak.sh -n mynode; and answer questions
2.) upload user's key, files2backup.txt, net-bak-node.sh at node
3.) you may test configuration by either:
  a) run % net-bak.sh -t; which is going to try to connect to node
  b) run % net-bak.sh -1 mynode; which is going to try to backup given node
4.) set-up cron for given user 


## Directory structure:

\
|- mynode
|  `- .node
|- logs
|  `- logfile-date.log
|
|- files2backup.txt
|- net-bak-node.sh
|- net-bak.sh
`- nodes2backup.txt

* files2backup.txt ~ files to back-up from node
* net-bak-node.sh ~ upload this script to node; executed via SSH
* net-bak.sh ~ main script executed at server
* nodes2backup.txt ~ list of names of nodes which corresponds with dir struct.


## .node file

Structure:
~~~ SNIP ~~~
NODEIP='1.2.3.4'
NODEWR='n'
NODEADMIN='root@domain.tld'
~~~ SNIP ~~~

* NODEIP ~ IP address or FQDN of node
* NODEWR ~ whether node is running OpenWRT White Russian or not
* NODEADMIN ~ whom to contact in case of problems (unused)
